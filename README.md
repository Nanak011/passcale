🔐 Password Strength Checker
This is a modern web-based password strength checker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project evaluates password strength based on common security criteria and provides feedback, including an estimate of how long it would take for an attacker to crack the password. The tool checks for:

Minimum length (≥ 8 characters)
Uppercase and lowercase letters
Numbers
Special characters
Entropy-based crack time estimate using brute-force assumptions
